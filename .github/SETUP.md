# GitHub Actions Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up automated Windows builds for PathFinder using GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Enable GitHub Actions
- Go to your repository on GitHub
- Click on the "Actions" tab
- Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"

### 2. Optional: Code Signing (Recommended for Production)

If you want to sign your Windows executables for better security and user trust:

#### Generate Code Signing Certificate
```bash
# Install OpenSSL (if not already installed)
# Then generate a self-signed certificate for testing
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

#### Add Secrets to GitHub Repository
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add these secrets (optional for unsigned builds):
   - `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your private key for code signing
   - `TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD`: Password for your private key

### 3. Test the Workflow

1. Push your changes to the `main` branch
2. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
3. You should see the "Build Windows App" workflow running
4. Wait for it to complete (usually 5-10 minutes)

## üì¶ Build Artifacts

The workflow creates two types of Windows installers:

### MSI Installer
- **Location**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/`
- **File**: `PathFinder_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi`
- **Use**: Standard Windows installer, integrates with Windows Add/Remove Programs

### NSIS Installer
- **Location**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`
- **File**: `PathFinder_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe`
- **Use**: Portable installer, smaller file size

## üîß Workflow Configuration

### Triggers
- **Push to main**: Builds and creates a draft release
- **Pull Request to main**: Builds for testing (no release)

### Build Process
1. **Checkout**: Downloads your code
2. **Setup Node.js**: Installs Node.js 18 with npm cache
3. **Setup Rust**: Installs Rust toolchain
4. **Install Dependencies**: Runs `npm ci` and `cargo fetch`
5. **Build Frontend**: Runs `npm run build`
6. **Build Tauri App**: Runs `npm run tauri:build`
7. **Upload Artifacts**: Saves installers as GitHub artifacts
8. **Create Release**: Creates a draft release (main branch only)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build fails with "cargo not found":**
- The workflow should handle this automatically
- If it persists, check the Rust setup step

**Build fails with "npm not found":**
- Check Node.js version in workflow (currently 18)
- Ensure package.json has correct scripts

**Code signing fails:**
- Check that `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` and `TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD` secrets are set
- Verify the private key format is correct

**Artifacts not uploading:**
- Check file paths in the upload steps
- Ensure the build completed successfully

### Debug Steps

1. **Check workflow logs:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Click on the failed workflow run
   - Expand the failed step to see error details

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri:build
   ```

3. **Check file paths:**
   - Verify the artifact paths match your build output
   - Check that the files exist after build

## üìã Manual Release Process

If you prefer to create releases manually:

1. Go to "Releases" in your repository
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Download artifacts from the latest workflow run
4. Upload the MSI and NSIS installers
5. Add release notes and publish

## üîÑ Customization

### Change Build Triggers
Edit `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml`:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]  # Add more branches
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly builds
```

### Add More Platforms
Create additional workflow files:
- `.github/workflows/build-macos.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build-linux.yml`

### Modify Build Commands
Update the workflow steps to customize the build process.

## üìä Monitoring

- **Build Status**: Check the Actions tab for build status
- **Artifacts**: Download from the Actions tab or Releases
- **Notifications**: GitHub will email you on build failures (if enabled)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test the workflow** with a small change
2. **Set up code signing** for production releases
3. **Configure release automation** for automatic publishing
4. **Add more platforms** if needed
5. **Set up notifications** for build status
